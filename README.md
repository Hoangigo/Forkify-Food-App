Food App Readme
This app is a web-based platform for searching and adding food items. It is built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.

Getting Started
To run the app locally, you can clone the repository using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-app.git
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file and extract it to your local machine.
and run npm start

Usage
Once you have the app running locally, you can use it to browse and purchase, add and search food items. The app has the following main features:

Browse food items by category
View food recipe details, including description and amount
Add recipe to the list
Bookmark your favorite recipe
Change amount of food ingredients according to number of servings

Development
If you want to modify the app, you can do so by editing the HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript files. The main files are located in the src folder:

index.html: the main HTML file
style.scss: the main SCSS file
script.js: the main JavaScript file
To compile the SCSS to CSS, you can use a tool like Sass. To do so, navigate to the src folder and run the following command:

Copy code
sass style.scss style.css
This will compile the style.scss file to style.css. You can then link to the style.css file in the index.html file.

Deployment
To deploy the app to a server, you can upload the files to a web hosting service. You can also use a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo to generate a static version of the app.
